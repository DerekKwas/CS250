# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? #

The best way to take a user's needs and implement them into a program is to break that need down.  For me, I would look at what is the overall functionality, and what is functionality that they would like included within it?  First iterations for me of a project would include a base setup with little to no formatting and no elements to make the program "pop", since we are first just trying to get the functionality done first and worry about the looks later.

Creating user stories helps with implementation by helping to break down the user's need with a little but more detailed information, but also giving you some sort of goal as of what the user would like the program to do.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? #

As stated above, my approach to developing programs involves breaking down the program into different sections so that I don't get overwhelmed with work.  These can essentially be thought of as mini finish lines to accomplish.  Some agile processes I hope to incorporate in my future development is to be better about creating a quick plan for development with the information known about what is to be accomplished.  Another element from agile I would like to incorporate is the need to focus development on things that provide value to the program instead of items that are merely cosmetic.  

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? #

I believe being a good team member means having quality communication amongst the team.  The reason quality communication is so important is that you can have communication, however quality communication involves being good at communicating ideas and plans in a way that everyone understands.  This would take some time with the team to understand what information works best the development of the team but once it is figured out can provide much value to the company.
